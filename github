In this new year I'd like to experiment with open publishing. 
My site, learning with moocs, is an [indie-website](https://learningwithmoocs.com/decentralized-web/indiewebifying-this-site/), 
but what about the whole process of writing an article? Software developers use sophisticated platforms and procedures to work 
collaboratively. 

They use [GitHub](https://github.com) and the version-control system [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). What if I
would use the same system to write posts, articles and longer stuff? I (or others) could make new versions of the master text, 
and eventually we could merge different versions into one document. It would be easy to go back in time
and restore an older version. Or several versions could co-exist.

I tried to use the command line interface to use GitHub and a new blogging workflow, but I fear it makes the process 
unnecessary complicated. Yet I want to give the command line a try. 

GitHub-tools relevant for this project are the wiki, comments and GitHub pages for blogging.

Loren Burton explains why GitHub is superior to Google Docs in [Github for Writers](http://www.madebyloren.com/posts/github-for-writers):

However, GitHub is created by developers for developers, so Burton explains, and he created a GitHub for writers, [Penflip](https://www.penflip.com/).
Konrad M. Lawson wrote a whole series about GibHub but concluded with [The Limitations of GitHub for Writers](https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/the-limitations-of-github-for-writers/48299).
