In this new year I'd like to experiment with open publishing. 
My site, learning with moocs, is an [indie-website](https://learningwithmoocs.com/decentralized-web/indiewebifying-this-site/), but what about the whole process of 
writing an article? Software developers use sophisticated platforms and procedures to work collaboratively. They use [GitHub](https://github.com) and the version-control system [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). What if I
would use the same system to write posts, articles and longer stuff? I (or others) could make new versions of the master text, and eventually we could merge different versions into one document. It would be easy to go back in time
and restore an older version. Or several versions could co-exist.
