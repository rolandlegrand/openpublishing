In this new year I'd like to experiment with open publishing. 
My site, learning with moocs, is an [indie-website](https://learningwithmoocs.com/decentralized-web/indiewebifying-this-site/), 
but what about the whole process of writing an article? Software developers use sophisticated platforms and procedures to work 
collaboratively. 

They use [GitHub](https://github.com) and the version-control system [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). What if I
would use the same system to write posts, articles and longer stuff? I (or others) could make new versions of the master text, 
and eventually we could merge different versions into one document. It would be easy to go back in time
and restore an older version. Or several versions could co-exist.

I tried to use the command line interface to use GitHub and a new blogging workflow, but I fear it makes the process 
unnecessary complicated. Yet I want to give the command line a try. 

GitHub-tools relevant for this project are the wiki, comments and GitHub pages for blogging. 

## Tutorials and Examples
On Medium JJ Merelo wrote about [Top ten reasons GitHub is a great tool for creative writers](https://medium.com/@jjmerelo/top-ten-reasons-github-is-a-great-tool-for-creative-writers-d0e8b27de71d).
Loren Burton explains why GitHub is superior to Google Docs in [Github for Writers](http://www.madebyloren.com/posts/github-for-writers):
> Contributors can make changes at will, without worrying about affecting anybody else.

However, GitHub is created by developers for developers, so Burton explains, and he created a GitHub for writers, [Penflip](https://www.penflip.com/).
Konrad M. Lawson wrote a whole series about GibHub but concluded with [The Limitations of GitHub for Writers](https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/the-limitations-of-github-for-writers/48299).

I even found a course on Udemy, [Git and GitHub for Writers](https://www.udemy.com/git-and-github-for-writers/). 

One example I know rather well is [The Peeragogy Handbook](http://peeragogy.github.io/) - I contributed the chapter about 
[massive open online courses](http://peeragogy.github.io/connectivism.html). You can fork the handbook on GitHub. 

If you're interested in math, don't miss the [textbook on informal homotopy type theory](https://github.com/HoTT/book).

JJ Merelo writes [fiction on GitHub](https://github.com/JJ/hoborg). 

Joe Buhlig [describes his GitHub-workflow](https://joebuhlig.com/writing-with-github/) as a writer. 

## Alternatives

One can hope to convince people to use Git and GitHub for non-coding projects, but an alternative is to rebuild GitHub to make
it more appealing for non-coders. I used Ole Begemann's article [Collaborative Writing on GitHub](https://oleb.net/blog/2016/02/collaborative-writing-on-github/)
for the following list: 

- We already mentioned [Penflip](https://www.penflip.com/).
- [Draft](https://draftin.com/)
- [Typewrite](https://typewrite.io/)
- [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/product)
- Begemann also recommends using [Kaleidoscope](https://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/) as a diff viewer (to detect differences between
versions. GitHub's diff viewer is efficient for code but less so for text). 
- Federico Viticci explains in 
[My Markdown Writing and Collaboration Workflow, Powered by Working Copy 3.6, iCloud Drive, and GitHub](https://www.macstories.net/ios/my-markdown-writing-and-collaboration-workflow-powered-by-working-copy-3-6-icloud-drive-and-github/)
how he uses the iOS-app Working Copy in his work, but then again maybe some readers prefer open source software.
